The malloc(), calloc(), valloc(), realloc(), and reallocf() functions
allocate memory.  The allocated memory is aligned such that it can be
used for any data type, including AltiVec- and SSE-related types.  The
aligned_alloc() function allocates memory with the requested alignment.
The free() function frees allocations that were created via the preceding
allocation functions.
